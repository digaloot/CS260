      <h1>Love Notes<sup>&reg;</sup></h1>
      <p class="introduction">
        Have you ever forgotten an important date? Anniversary, birthday, or something important to someone you care about? 
        What if you could take just a few minutes to fill out a list of people you want reminders for. For each person, you 
        fill out a list of dates for what is important about that person. Then on those dates, you get a reminder to tell them 
        how much that day means to you. Better yet, you get a sample message that you can click to forward or you can edit or 
        replace it before sending it to that important someone. You have a reminder each time that day comes around with a 
        message sent from you to them and you have now been reminded yourself for in person conversations.
